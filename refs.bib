	pages        = 14,
	note         = 00016,
	abstract     = {The relationship between Urban Heat Island ({UHI}) and energy consumption in buildings has been widely observed and studied. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of large-scale deployment of indirect Vertical Greenery Systems ({VGS}) on the cooling demand of buildings and on the urban microclimate. {VGS} signicantly reduces air temperature and wind speed near the walls. In doing so, it also positively impacts the {UHI} intensity. This is achieved mainly through the conversion of sensible heat to latent heat mediated by evaporation and transpiration from the {VGS} foliage. Evapotranspiration is a physically complex phenomenon and its interaction with the building and the urban climate is diffcult to model accurately. We propose to use a dynamic nonlinear lumped parameter thermal network model to determine the thermal interactions between the prototypical building, the {VGS}, the paved road, the urban canopy air and the atmosphere. The model accounts for both sensible and latent exchanges within and outside the building. Solar (short-wave) radiation on building face ade and road accounts for shading and unlimited diffuse reactions. Long-wave radiation among surfaces and between surfaces and the sky are estimated using view factors and the fully nonlinear Stefan-Bolzmann law. Building envelope infiltration rate and convective heat transfer coefficient vary with wind speed so as to properly respect the energetic impact of wind speed attenuation near the wall due to the foliage. The thermal and aerodynamic characterization of the vegetation is based on the formulations proposed by Deardorff (1978). The evapotranspiration rate is estimated based on the Penman formula and is driven by the 'vapor pressure deficit' between actual vapor pressure in the ambient air and the saturation vapor pressure assumed to prevail on the surface of leaves. The calculation of sensible and latent heat fluxes between the urban canopy and the first level of the atmosphere considers buoyancy effects, using the coefficients introduced by Mascart et al. (1995). First, a base case model (no {VGS}) is created and validated using both building energy consumption data and urban air temperature measurements. The validated model is then used to investigate the impact of a large-scale deployment of {VGS} in the urban context. The weather data and the typical building thermo-physical properties are from the {UAE}. Comparison of the urban base case to the rural base case (both without {VGS}) shows a cooling load penalty, due to the {UHI}, of about 7\%. Retrofitting {VGS} to all buildings in the urban domain of study results in a 5 - 8\% reduction of the cooling load and a dramatic drop of the urban air temperature of about 0.7 - 0.9 $\deg$C, reducing the {UHI} intensity by almost half.},

In addition to quantification of risk today, the role of aggravating factors such as high population growth and changing climate conditions matters, too. We present the open-source software CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), which integrates hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to compute the necessary metrics to assess risk and to quantify socio-economic impact. The software design is modular and object oriented, offering a simple collaborative framework and a parallelization strategy which allows for scalable computations on clusters. CLIMADA supports multi-hazard calculations and provides an event-based probabilistic approach that is globally consistent for a wide range of resolutions, suitable for whole-country to detailed local studies. This paper uses the platform to estimate and contextualize the damage of hurricane Irma in the Caribbean in 2017. Most of the affected islands are non-sovereign countries and also rely on overseas support in case disaster strikes. The risk assessment performed for this region, based on remotely available data available shortly before or hours after landfall of Irma, proves to be close to reported damage and hence demonstrates a method to provide readily available impact estimates and associated uncertainties in real time.},

Drought management frameworks are dependent on methods for monitoring and prediction, but quantifying the hazard alone is arguably not sufficient; the negative consequences that may arise from a lack of precipitation must also be predicted if droughts are to be better managed. However, the link between drought intensity, expressed by some hydrometeorological indicator, and the occurrence of drought impacts has only recently begun to be addressed. One challenge is the paucity of information on ecological and socioeconomic consequences of drought. This study tests the potential for developing empirical drought impact functions based on drought indicators (Standardized Precipitation and Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index) as predictors and text-based reports on drought impacts as a surrogate variable for drought damage. While there have been studies exploiting textual evidence of drought impacts, a systematic assessment of the effect of impact quantification method and different functional relationships for modeling drought impacts is missing. Using Southeast England as a case study we tested the potential of three different data-driven models for predicting drought impacts quantified from text-based reports: logistic regression, zero-altered negative binomial regression (hurdle model), and an ensemble regression tree approach (random forest). The logistic regression model can only be applied to a binary impact/no impact time series, whereas the other two models can additionally predict the full counts of impact occurrence at each time point. While modeling binary data results in the lowest prediction uncertainty, modeling the full counts has the advantage of also providing a measure of impact severity, and the counts were found to be reasonably predictable. However, there were noticeable differences in skill between modeling methodologies. For binary data the logistic regression and the random forest model performed similarly well based on leave-one-out cross validation. For count data the random forest outperformed the hurdle model. The between-model differences occurred for total drought impacts and for two subsets of impact categories (water supply and freshwater ecosystem impacts). In addition, different ways of defining the impact counts were investigated and were found to have little influence on the prediction skill. For all models we found a positive effect of including impact information of the preceding month as a predictor in addition to the hydrometeorological indicators. We conclude that, although having some limitations, text-based reports on drought impacts can provide useful information for drought risk management, and our study showcases different methodological approaches to developing drought impact functions based on text-based data.},

Future natural disaster losses are expected to increase due to a continued increase in economic exposure and climate change. This highlights the importance of designing policies that can mitigate the impacts of these disasters on the economy and society. A rapidly expanding literature has estimated the direct (e.g., property damage) and indirect (e.g., gross domestic product growth, trade) economic impacts of natural disasters. This article reviews this emerging literature. We synthesize the main theoretical, computational, and empirical methods used, summarize key findings on the economic impacts of natural disasters, and discuss factors that have been found to mitigate disaster impacts. We conclude by identifying lessons for policymakers and outlining an agenda for future research in this field.},

Increasing interdependencies across infrastructures and supply chains pose substantial challenges for those seeking to move resources, and flood risk managers aiming to reduce the disruption to resource movements before, during and after a flood event. This paper introduces a quantitative resource model that embeds input-output relationships of supply and demand within a spatial network model which enables the impacts of a spatial hazard, such as a flood, to be evaluated. The model has been tested in the Shetland Islands and New York City. The analysis supports observations that a single flood event can disrupt the movement of resources far beyond the flooded area. Disruption of critical sectors can rapidly lead to collapse of the entire system given certain conditions. Resource management strategies, such as diversifying supply chains, reduced clustering of industry and storing supplies locally are shown to reduce the magnitude of the initial impact, and slow the propagation of the disruption through the system +- providing useful insights to flood risk managers and planners.},

Faced with growing uncertainties, managers are struggling to find appropriate risk management strategies. Alongside traditional risk management strategies, the concept of Urban Resilience is embedded in political discourses, international and local strategies. However, this concept remains still very abstract for a lot of actors, a buzzword difficult to operationalize. The objective of this work is to concretize urban resilience to floods by proposing a spatial decision support tool co-built with urban managers. The proposed methodology is a holistic approach integrating three indicators of resilience applied to the Avignon case study (Provence Alpes C\^{o}te d'Azur Region).},

Therefore, the French National Climate Change Adaptation Plan has defined actions in its field "transport infrastructures and systems". Transversal working groups with experts of various transport infrastructures were established in 2011 and have developed a strong cooperation to address this issue. They published: i) a thorough review of technical, regulatory and normative standards that require an update to adapt construction, maintenance and operation of infrastructures and networks to climate trends and ii) a risk assessment framework to prevent future extreme weather events on transport.

  Title		= {Supply Chain Management in View of Climate Change: an
	Overview of Possible Impacts and the Road Ahead},
  Abstract	= { Purpose: The paper aims to provide a general overview of
	the impacts of climate change upon supply chains and to
	analyze the implications of climate change for supply chain
	management in terms of strategic and operational planning.
	A roadmap of fruitful research approaches is also
	presented. Design/methodology/approach: The paper makes use
	of a general review of the relevant literature and, based
	on a systematic categorization of the findings, looks for
	useful insights towards the issues of climate change and
	supply chain management. A framework is drawn for
	systematically assessing the impacts of climate change upon
	supply chains and their management, while making
	suggestions for future research. Findings and
	Originality/value: Supply chain networks run physical,
	operational and reputational risks attributed to climate
	change. Escalation in regulations, market forces and
	stakeholders' pressures are paving the way for the
	decarbonization of supply chains with obvious implications
	for supply chain management. Supply chain managers should
	pay special attention to the impacts of climate change on
	supply chains and academics should further explore the
	interrelationships between climate change and supply chain
	design and operations. Research limitations/implications:
	Additional qualitative research based on grounded theory is
	suggested for validating and interconnecting the findings
	with empirical data. Practical implications: The paper
	provides several insights towards the issues of supply
	chain management in view of climate change and may serve as
	an initial basis for exploring future research directions
	by academics. Practitioners, especially those drafting
	value-creating supply chain agendas, may also find these
	insights useful for improving their managerial practices.
	Originality/value: By providing an original structured
	overview of the impacts of climate change upon supply chain
	design and operations management the paper substantiates
	the need for management improvements and provides research
	directions that may prove valuable to researchers. },

Un diagnostic est d'abord tir{\'e} de l'examen d'un {\'e}chec fran{\c{c}}ais (la taxe carbone de N. Sarkozy, 2009-2010).

	abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to assess the possible contribution of an input-output model towards two of the basic principles of the sustainability strategy of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and Post-Normal Science. According to these principles, decision-support tools should offer a holistic perspective and handle high uncertainty. The difficulties in reaching sustainability are due partly to the prevailing use of "narrow-system-boundary" tools that are non-holistic. Consequently, they fail to capture important ecosystem services and ignore interdependencies between them. To comply with the basic principles, our method allows environmental assets to be evaluated in multiple units and integrates results from recent researches in natural sciences. Both enable coverage of interdependencies between ecosystem services. Thereby, we enlarge input-output modelling from the two conventional ecosystem services of sink and provisioning to the most vital ones: the supporting services. An application to the Seine estuary addresses the impacts of maritime transportation infrastructures on nursery habitats for commercial fish. The ecosystem services covered are life support and resource provisioning. Our results show that the restoration of a total of 73.7km2 of nursery areas over the period 2004-2015 would result in a stock of sole in 2015 that exceeds the "business as usual" scenario by 44.2\% (uncertainty range: 35.9\%-69.9\%). In spite of high restoration costs, the negative macro-economic impact is very low. However, on the sector level, a trade-off results between nurseries and three economic sectors. The quantification of such trade-offs in our model is particularly useful to public participation in decision-making.},

A risk-based methodology is a powerful tool to achieve certain strategic choices when resources are not extensible (e.g., for the management of a stock of existing structures, or their upgrade, to respond to a particular risk, such as a seismic or climate change risk). Risk analysis also allows for the definition of a strategy to monitor and inspect or to prioritize upgrade actions (e.g., to repair, strengthen). In this sense, risk analysis alone is necessary but is not sufficient: it must precede the decision as part of an overall risk management process. This paper presents risk analysis methodology and its application to two families of structures developed and implemented by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy (in charge of transportation) on the national road network of France.},

A roadmap of fruitful research approaches is also presented. Design/methodology/approach: The paper makes use of a general review of the relevant literature and, based on a systematic categorization of the findings, looks for useful insights towards the issues of climate change and supply chain management. A framework is drawn for systematically assessing the impacts of climate change upon supply chains and their management, while making suggestions for future research. Findings and Originality/value: Supply chain networks run physical, operational and reputational risks attributed to climate change. Escalation in regulations, market forces and stakeholders' pressures are paving the way for the decarbonization of supply chains with obvious implications for supply chain management. Supply chain managers should pay special attention to the impacts of climate change on supply chains and academics should further explore the interrelationships between climate change and supply chain design and operations. Research limitations/implications: Additional qualitative research based on grounded theory is suggested for validating and interconnecting the findings with empirical data. Practical implications: The paper provides several insights towards the issues of supply chain management in view of climate change and may serve as an initial basis for exploring future research directions by academics. Practitioners, especially those drafting value-creating supply chain agendas, may also find these insights useful for improving their managerial practices. Originality/value: By providing an original structured overview of the impacts of climate change upon supply chain design and operations management the paper substantiates the need for management improvements and provides research directions that may prove valuable to researchers.},

	abstract     = {Typically, a climate change risk assessment focuses on individual sectors or hazards. However, interdependencies between climate risks manifest themselves via functional, physical, geographical, economic, policy and social mechanisms. These can occur over a range of spatial or temporal scales and with different strengths of coupling. Three case studies are used to demonstrate how interdependencies can significantly alter the nature and magnitude of risk, and, consequently, investment priorities for adaptation. The three examples explore interdependencies that arise from (1) climate loading dependence; (2) mediation of two climate impacts by physical processes operating over large spatial extents; and, (3) multiple risks that are influenced by shared climatic and socio-economic drivers. Drawing upon learning from these case studies, and other work, a framework for the analysis and consideration of interdependencies in climate change risk assessment has been developed. This is an iterative learning loop that involves defining the system, scoping interaction mechanisms, applying appropriate modelling tools, identifying vulnerabilities and opportunities, and assessing the performance of adaptation interventions.},

However, these studies ignore the fact that migration will be dampened by changes in wage rates and housing prices as a result of migration. In this study, we apply a novel approach of linking a residential sorting model to an interregional computable general equilibrium model of the United States to capture wage and housing price feedbacks to assess the economic impacts of climate-change-induced migration. We find that endogenizing wages significantly dampens migration patterns. However, there are significant positive impacts on gross regional product and consumption in the Northeast, West, and California at the expense of the South and Midwest. In addition, wage effects are found to dominate housing price and climate effects, which results in larger welfare changes.},

We argue that this may lead to estimation bias as damage data and the selection into the database may correlate with GDP. We build a comprehensive database of disaster events and their intensities from primary geophysical and meteorological information. In contrast to insurance data, our GeoMet data reveal a substantial negative and robust average impact effect of disasters on growth. The worst 5\% disaster years come with a growth damage of at least 0.46 percentage points. That average effect is driven mainly by very large earthquakes and some meteorological disasters. Poor countries are more strongly affected by geophysical disasters; rich more by meteorological events. International openness and democratic institutions reduce the adverse effect of disasters.},

This paper examines the conventional use of location quotients (LQs) to estimate regional input-output coefficients from national data. A new L Q-based adjustment formula is developed. By allowing for relative regional size, this new formula should overcome the tendency of conventional formulae to overstate regional multipliers. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the conventional approach of first producing an aggregated regional model and then using LQs to adjust the coefficients is likely to produce biased estimates of regional multipliers; it is argued that it would be more sensible to adjust the data prior to aggregation. The arguments are illustrated using data for the English county of Avon. FLEGG A. T., WEBBER C. D. et ELLIOTT M. V.

Dar{\"u}ber hinaus wird aufgezeigt, da{\ss} die konventionelle Handhabung des Problems in zwei Schritten: der Schaffung eines aggregierten Regionalmodells mit darauffolgender Verwendung von LQs zur Angleichung der Koeffizienten, durchaus voreingenommene Einsch{\"a}tzungen regionaler Multiplikatoren zeitigen kann; es wird die Ansicht vertreten, das es vern{\"u}nftiger w{\"a}re, die Daten vor ihrer Zusammenf{\"u}gung einander anzupassen.

	abstract     = {Climate change, as well as associated mitigation efforts, will substantially disrupt some economies. Seemingly inevitable market and policy changes will push economies to transition away from reliance on industries with higher carbon emissions and bring transient economic impacts, especially in regions that are currently heavily reliant on such industries. This situation is not unusual in a global context. To underpin betterinformed decisions that enable a smoother economic transition to a low-emissions future, we developed a 'latent economic vulnerability to emissions reduction' (LEVER) index, which maps and explores regions that are more likely to be economically impacted from climate change mitigation. Thus, this paper provides an analysis and discussion of the potential regional implications of a future low-emissions economy, with the analysis contextualised for the state of Queensland, Australia. Given this case study, the economic impacts and future of coal-fired power stations, coal mining and renewable energy are discussed. The LEVER index weighs the risk of high carbon economic exposure against the variability in carbon economic resilience from employment in low-emission sectors across local economies. We find that between 3 and 6 per cent of Queensland regions are assessed as having a very high latent economic vulnerability to increased decarbonisation of industrial activities. To promote a smoother transition, these regions will require targeted investments and strategies to enable their transition towards lower carbon-intensive systems, while maximising economic and social outcomes.},

There is evidence that some types of weather and climate extremes, like heat waves and flooding, have already increased or intensified over the last few decades, and climate projections reveal a further intensification for many types of weather and climate extremes in many regions though the uncertainties still remain large. While there is evidence for increases in economic losses it is uncertain whether this is due to an increase in the number and intensity of extreme events or can be attributed to socio-economic changes. However, there is agreement that the increasingly complex and internationally distributed supply chains of global companies make them more vulnerable to extreme weather events. It is also thought that global warming will adversely affect the global food supply chain and especially developing countries. Here I survey how weather and climate extremes impact our economies and how we can mitigate their impacts using financial and insurance products.},

Various methods have been applied to derive such tables from their national counterparts using all available information on the sectoral structure of the regional economy. In this paper a partial survey approach is followed in the construction of input-output tables for two Austrian NUTS II regions. Based on the 1995 national input-output table, which is the first national table consistent with the new European System of Accounts (ESA 1995), make and use tables are estimated and an input-output table broken down by activities is derived. In addition to using different secondary regional data and estimates of regional final demand, the table construction relies on data from a survey of regional exports. The first part of the paper describes the methodology followed to build the tables. The second part compares regional and national tables in order to analyse differences in the productive structure.},

There is an urgent need to manage climate change risks in global supply chains. Following a systematic literature review and text mining approach, 90 interdisciplinary articles between the years 2005 and 2018 were studied. Thematic and descriptive analysis identifies sources, consequences and control mechanisms for the climate change risks. It is found that climate change driven by extreme weather conditions significantly impacts food production, natural resources and transportation worldwide. This direct impact on food, mining and logistics sectors cascades into other interlinked global supply chain network. Climate change and supply chains are found to be mutually influencing each other through natural disasters and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions respectively. A systems theory driven, novel supply chain risk management framework for managing climate change risks is proposed. The study contributes to supply chain risk management literature by capturing the nexus between climate change and supply chain management.},

This paper aims to compile and discuss publications comprising damage functions for transport assets. Design/methodology/approach The research included the collection of contemplable literature and the subsequent screening for damage functions and information on them. In conclusion, the derived damage curves and formulae were transferred to a unified design. Findings Damage functions for the transport sector are scarce in the literature. Although specific damage functions for particular transport assets exist, they mainly consider infrastructure or transport in general. Occasionally, damage curves for the same asset in different publications vary. Major research gaps persist in wildfire damage estimation. Research limitations/implications The study scope was restricted to the hazards of fluvial floods and wildfires. Despite all efforts, this study did not cover all existing literature on the topic. Originality/value This publication summarises the state of the art of research concerning transport asset damage functions, and hence contributes to the facilitation of prospective research on CI performance, resilience and vulnerability modelling.},

Traditional analysis methods-based on evaluating the model at a reference parameter vector and changing one parameter at a time-are local, linear, and usually do not capture interactions among the parameters. By contrast, the global sensitivity analysis that we present summarizes the parameters' importance over a range of values, fully capturing nonlinearities and identifying interactions. Specifically, we propose Sobol' indices, which are based on variance decomposition, and exemplify their use with a standard real business cycle model. Standard approaches to variance decomposition require a large number of model evaluations. To overcome this, we present the state-of-the-art approach for calculating Sobol' indices, which is based on building a polynomial representation of the model from a limited number of evaluations. In addition, we use this polynomial representation to evaluate the univariate effects, which are conditional expectation functions that can be interpreted as a robust impact of a parameter on the model conclusions.},

	abstract     = {In this work we develop a novel Input-Output linear programming model to study the energy-economic recovery resilience of an economy by analyzing the relationships between energy production disruption, impacts on sectoral production and demands, and post-disruption recovery efforts. The proposed model evaluates the minimum level of recovery investments required to restore production levels so that total economic impacts are acceptable over a stipulated post-disruption duration. It is assumed that disruptions are uncertain and can occur at different sectors and possibly simultaneously. The optimization model is then solved using a cutting plane method which involves computing a small sequence of mixed integer programming problems of moderate dimensions. A case study using China 2012 Input-Output data is performed, and we demonstrate the model's ability to uncover critical inter-sectoral dependencies at different disruption levels. This provides decision-makers with important information in evaluating and improving the energy-economic resilience in a systematic and rigorous manner.},

Thus, it serves to examine the robustness of numerical results with respect to input parameters, which is a prerequisite for deriving economic conclusions from them. In practice, modellers apply different methods, often chosen ad hoc, to do sensitivity analysis. This paper pursues a systematic approach. It formalizes deterministic and stochastic methods used for sensitivity analysis. Moreover, it presents the numerical algorithms to apply the methods, in particular, an improved version of a Gauss-Quadrature algorithm, applicable to one as well as multidimensional sensitivity analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods and algorithms are discussed as well as their applicability.},

These developments are discussed in more detail in the chapter. It presents some linkages of input-output analysis with other standard modeling techniques, further reinforcing the notion that the input-output framework has a considerable degree of flexibility in its contribution to an understanding of the structure of an economy. The chapter explores in detail the input-output model and its characteristics and provides several extensions of input-output analysis.},

By allowing this bs parameter to vary, a realistic scatter in maximum winds for a given central pressure is obtained. This provides an improvement over traditional approaches that provide a unique wind for each central pressure. It is further recommended that application of the Dvorak satellite-interpretation technique be changed to enable a direct derivation of central pressure. The pressure-wind model derived here can then provide the maximum wind estimates. The recent North Atlantic data archive is shown to be largely derived from the use of the Dvorak technique, even when hurricane reconnaissance data are available and Dvorak overestimates maximum winds in this region for the more intense hurricanes. Application to the full North Atlantic hurricane archive confirms the findings by Landsea (1993) of a substantial overestimation of maximum winds between 1950 and 1980; the Landsea corrections do not completely remove this bias.},

The result shows that the simulation reproduces the aftermath of the disaster well, which means the simulation captures the propagations of the damages and the recoveries on supply chains. (2) Indirect damages of both earthquakes geographically permeate the entire country in quite a short term. Additionally, the damages to firms show synchronized fluctuations due to the network structure. (3) Simulations of the Nankai Trough Earthquake show that direct damages are 12 times greater than those from the Great East Japan Earthquake, but indirect damages are approximately 4.5 times greater in a year. (4) By estimating indirect damage triggered by a single firm loss, approximately 10\% of firms cause more than 10\% of the damage of the entire supply chains.},

  Title= {Climate Change and Critical Infrastructure - Floods},
  Abstract= {This study investigates the change in the level of risk to
critical infrastructure due to the impact of climate change
on the frequency and severity of floods. We implement a
case study focused on the power grid to demonstrate the
methodology. The consideration of the power outage
substantially changes the estimated losses from the flood
scenario. The economic losses due to the interruption of
the daily economic activity are 6 to 8 times greater if the
power outage outside the inundated area is taken into
consideration. In addition, the losses from the disruption
of daily economic activity far outweigh the cost of
transmission asset repairs, and amount to 99\% of the total
cost.},

  Title= {Defining Water-Related Energy for Global Comparison,
Clearer Communication, and Sharper Policy},
  Abstract= { The need for energy in water provision and use is
obvious, however the drivers are often complex, difficult
to assess, and often inconsistently presented. Here we
build a clearer definition and conceptual framework of
"water-related energy". We apply this framework to
harmonise data and results across disparate studies so that
regional estimates of water-related energy can be compared
in a consistent way for the first time. We show how widely
different boundaries have been used for analysis including
or excluding: water and wastewater utilities, as well as
residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural water
users. Consequently, understanding of what constitutes
"water-related energy" is widely divergent. We demonstrate
how up to 12.6\% of total national primary energy use can
be influenced by water, when (i) water-related energy of
water users, and (ii) energy use by water utilities, are
all included. Water heating for residential, commercial,
and industrial purposes is the dominant fraction. Water and
wastewater utilities use 0.4-2.3\% of primary energy or
0.6-6.2\% of regional electricity, mostly for water
pumping. This is substantial, but lower than frequent
claims in the media and reports. To answer how is
miscommunication influencing policy? we undertake a novel
systematic tracking of communication to demonstrate
distortion between research and its application in
government reports, media and policy. We show that
significant confusion is caused by (i) unclear or
inconsistent boundaries (ii) widely differing use of terms
for water "system", "sector", and "supply", (iii) frequent
failure to distinguish 'energy' from 'electricity' and (iv)
wide use of non-standard units. While acknowledging that
media is often less accurate than government reports, and
that peer-reviewed articles generally have highest overall
quality, we observe miscommunication and inconsistency in
all publication forms. We argue a global protocol is needed
to improve consistency of analysis and sharpen policy
towards sustainable water end use because this is where
most water-related energy occurs. We establish a
foundational framework and definitions for this protocol
while recognising much more needs to be done. The strong
practical and theoretical implications of the work for
sustainable cleaner production are elucidated. This is
timely, as global quantification of water-related energy
has yet to occur particularly for water end-use which is
the dominant component. },

  Title= {A {{Multiregional Impact Assessment Model}} for Disaster
Analysis},
  Abstract= { This paper presents a recursive dynamic multiregional
supply-use model, combining linear programming and
input-output (I-O) modeling to assess the economy-wide
consequences of a natural disaster on a pan-European scale.
It is a supply-use model which considers production
technologies and allows for supply side constraints. The
model has been illustrated for three floods in Rotterdam,
The Netherlands. Results show that most of the neighboring
regions gain from the flood due to increased demand for
reconstruction and production capacity constraints in the
affected region. Regions located further away or
neighboring regions without a direct export link to the
affected region mostly suffered small losses. These losses
are due to the costs of increased inefficiencies in the
production process that have to be paid for by all
(indirectly) consuming regions. In the end, the floods
cause regionally differentiated welfare effects. },

To this end, a fundamental change in scientific approaches to disaster risk reduction is needed by shifting the current emphasis on individual hazard and risk assessment dominant in the geoscientific community to a transdisciplinary system analysis with action-oriented research on disaster risk reduction co-produced with multiple stakeholders, including policymakers. This paradigm shift will allow for acquisition of policy-relevant knowledge and its immediate application to evidence-based policy and decision making for disaster risk reduction. The need for the paradigm shift is more critical now than ever before because of the increasing vulnerability and exposure of society to disaster risk and the need for cross-cutting actions in policy and practice related to climate change and sustainability.},

In the context of supply chains, previous works have demonstrated the efficacy of inventory as a mitigation strategy to delay the impact of disruptive events. However, current methods tend to focus only on a demand-driven approach, which may be inappropriate for some systems where a value-added price perturbation represents an impact. Thus, this paper offers a methodology for understanding the role of inventory in the supply-side dynamic inoperability input-output model (DIIM). To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, an illustrative example is presented using data from the 2012 Philippines Input-Output (I-O) Table in five different scenarios. Given a predefined planning horizon, the results of this work can serve as guidelines for decision-makers for the provision of inventory that will keep the overall inoperability of an entire supply chain at a minimum.},

	abstract     = {Drought is an economically important hazard for many countries, with the potential to cause large direct and indirect economic losses. Superimposed on this risk is the danger that future anthropogenic climate change poses. The study utilises projected estimates of direct drought losses, for a variety of different climate change scenarios, to assess how input-output analysis could be used to estimate indirect losses. Modifications were made to the adaptive regional input-output model to consider both the severity of individual drought events and the propagation of economic losses over time and applied to a case study of Spain. The study highlights the importance of the distribution of drought severity and direct losses over time when modelling indirect losses, emphasising a need to focus on time steps shorter than a year to model losses more comprehensively. The results suggest that annual drought losses in 2003-2050 could be up to 32~\% higher for short-term droughts if indirect economic losses were considered and 57~\% higher for longer-term droughts. Indirect losses were shown to increase nonlinearly over time and as emission scenarios became more severe. This suggests that the benefits of stringent mitigation policies in terms of avoided indirect losses may be more substantial than for direct losses in the second half of the twenty-first century. Whilst the estimates presented here are considered illustrative, the study highlights the importance of considering indirect economic losses for providing more comprehensive economic estimates of drought loss under future climate change and for assessing economic benefits of future mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

It has appeared that including resilience measures in the modelling approach, which may mute the losses considerably, is a challenging task. At the same time it is necessary because it prevents the modeller from generating overestimates. This study presents two directions to improve the modelling of (economic) resilience for which the state-of-the art with respect to dynamic inoperability input-output modelling is taken as a starting point. Firstly, the new model allows for a different recovery path than the traditionally assumed 'concave up decreasing curve' describes for a disrupted infrastructure or economic sector in the aftermath of a disaster. In this paper, we explain how the recovery path may depend on the type of disaster. Secondly, the model refines the aspect of 'inventory' as a resilience measure. Inventory is interpreted in a broad sense here: it can be any resilience measures which enable an infrastructure or economic sector to continue its supply despite being disrupted. The model is applied to both a simple two-sector illustrative example and a severe winter storm scenario in Europe using economic data from the World Input-Output Database to show its practical usefulness.},

The scale of damage assessment varies from a specified flood-prone area in a river basin or a coastal region to the country's entire economy. The integrative character of the presented model is featured by the combination of information on land use and economic data, and data on flood characteristics and stage-damage functions, where the geographical dimension is supported by modern GIS to obtain a damage estimate for various damage categories. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated in a case study estimating expected flood damage in the largest flood-prone area in the Netherlands.},

  Title= {Modeling {{Imbalanced Economic Recovery Following}} a
{{Natural Disaster Using Input}}-{{Output Analysis}}},
  Abstract= { Input-output analysis is frequently used in studies of
large-scale weather-related (e.g., Hurricanes and flooding)
disruption of a regional economy. The economy after a
sudden catastrophe shows a multitude of imbalances with
respect to demand and production and may take months or
years to recover. However, there is no consensus about how
the economy recovers. This article presents a theoretical
route map for imbalanced economic recovery called dynamic
inequalities. Subsequently, it is applied to a hypothetical
postdisaster economic scenario of flooding in London around
the year 2020 to assess the influence of future shocks to a
regional economy and suggest adaptation measures. Economic
projections are produced by a macro econometric model and
used as baseline conditions. The results suggest that
London's economy would recover over approximately 70 months
by applying a proportional rationing scheme under the
assumption of initial 50\% labor loss (with full recovery
in six months), 40\% initial loss to service sectors, and
10-30\% initial loss to other sectors. The results also
suggest that imbalance will be the norm during the
postdisaster period of economic recovery even though
balance may occur temporarily. Model sensitivity analysis
suggests that a proportional rationing scheme may be an
effective strategy to apply during postdisaster economic
reconstruction, and that policies in transportation
recovery and in health care are essential for effective
postdisaster economic recovery. },

	abstract     = {The need for energy in water provision and use is obvious, however the drivers are often complex, difficult to assess, and often inconsistently presented. Here we build a clearer definition and conceptual framework of "water-related energy". We apply this framework to harmonise data and results across disparate studies so that regional estimates of water-related energy can be compared in a consistent way for the first time. We show how widely different boundaries have been used for analysis including or excluding: water and wastewater utilities, as well as residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural water users. Consequently, understanding of what constitutes "water-related energy" is widely divergent. We demonstrate how up to 12.6\% of total national primary energy use can be influenced by water, when (i) water-related energy of water users, and (ii) energy use by water utilities, are all included. Water heating for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes is the dominant fraction. Water and wastewater utilities use 0.4-2.3\% of primary energy or 0.6-6.2\% of regional electricity, mostly for water pumping. This is substantial, but lower than frequent claims in the media and reports. To answer how is miscommunication influencing policy? we undertake a novel systematic tracking of communication to demonstrate distortion between research and its application in government reports, media and policy. We show that significant confusion is caused by (i) unclear or inconsistent boundaries (ii) widely differing use of terms for water "system", "sector", and "supply", (iii) frequent failure to distinguish 'energy' from 'electricity' and (iv) wide use of non-standard units. While acknowledging that media is often less accurate than government reports, and that peer-reviewed articles generally have highest overall quality, we observe miscommunication and inconsistency in all publication forms. We argue a global protocol is needed to improve consistency of analysis and sharpen policy towards sustainable water end use because this is where most water-related energy occurs. We establish a foundational framework and definitions for this protocol while recognising much more needs to be done. The strong practical and theoretical implications of the work for sustainable cleaner production are elucidated. This is timely, as global quantification of water-related energy has yet to occur particularly for water end-use which is the dominant component. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The positive effect prevails for companies with larger shares of intangible assets. Regarding the firms' productivity a negative flood effect is observable which declines with an increasing share of intangible assets.},

This thoroughly revised second edition includes twenty essays--twelve of which are new to this edition--that reflect the past developments and the present state of the field. Beginning with an introductory chapter, the book leads the reader into an understanding of the input-output approach--not only as formal theory but also as a research strategy and powerful tool for dealing with a complex modern economy.},

  Title= {Badly Hurt{?} {Natural} Disasters and Direct Firm
Effects},
  Abstract= {We investigate firm outcomes after a major flood in
Germany in 2013. We robustly find that firms located in
the disaster regions have significantly higher turnover,
lower leverage, and higher cash in the period after 2013.
We provide evidence that the effects stem from firms that
already experienced a similar major disaster in 2002.
Overall, our results document a positive net effect on
firm performance in the direct aftermath of a natural
disaster.},

	abstract     = {Les travaux de cette th{\`e}se se situent dans le cadre de l'{\'e}largissement du p{\'e}rim{\`e}tre des impacts estim{\'e}s par le mod{\`e}le inondation de la Caisse Centrale de R{\'e}assurance (CCR). Le premier chapitre nous a permis de comprendre les diff{\'e}rents impacts d'une inondation, leurs interd{\'e}pendances et d'en conclure une classification des impacts. A partir de cela, nous proposons un mod{\`e}le global construit par cha\^{\i}nage de mod{\'e}lisation des impacts o\`{u} les outputs des diff{\'e}rents mod{\`e}les servent d'inputs pour les mod{\`e}les suivants. Cette d{\'e}marche permettra d'avoir une r{\'e}partition des impacts par poste et une compr{\'e}hension des effets en cascade des dommages directs vers les effets macro-{\'e}conomiques. Le chapitre 2 s'int{\'e}resse {\`a} la mod{\'e}lisation des dommages aux v{\'e}hicules sous le cahier des charges de CCR. Les diff{\'e}rentes conditions {\`a} respecter sont : la mod{\'e}lisation pour le p{\'e}ril inondation seul et du risque automobile seul, la mod{\'e}lisation pour un {\'e}v{\'e}nement particulier et pour la charge totale annuelle. L'{\'e}tude de ce risque, nous a permis de d{\'e}crire, d'impl{\'e}menter, d'identifier les probl{\`e}mes et possibles am{\'e}liorations de diff{\'e}rentes approches de mod{\'e}lisation, {\`a} savoir : - une r{\'e}gression lin{\'e}aire, la m{\'e}thodologie aujourd'hui utilis{\'e}e par CCR, - une mod{\'e}lisation fr{\'e}quence x s{\'e}v{\'e}rit{\'e} associ{\'e}e {\`a} la th{\'e}orie des valeurs extr\^{e}mes, tr{\`e}s utilis{\'e}e dans le monde de l'assurance, - une mod{\'e}lisation physique sur exposition, d{\'e}marche d{\'e}j{\`a} adopt{\'e}e {\`a} CCR pour les dommages au b\^{a}ti. Nous nous sommes donc appuy{\'e}s sur le mod{\`e}le d'al{\'e}a inondation CCR et avons d{\'e}velopp{\'e} les modules de vuln{\'e}rabilit{\'e} et de dommages propres {\`a} ce risque. CCR {\'e}tant charg{\'e}e de la gestion comptable et financi{\`e}re du Fonds National de Gestion des Risques en Agriculture pour le compte de l'Etat, les travaux se sont poursuivi, dans le chapitre 3, par la mod{\'e}lisation du risque agricole. A partir d'un {\'e}tat de l'art sur la mod{\'e}lisation des cons{\'e}quences agricoles des inondations, une mod{\'e}lisation de ce risque est propos{\'e}e et impl{\'e}ment{\'e}e. Le mod{\`e}le s'int{\`e}gre dans la d{\'e}marche de mod{\'e}lisation physique sur exposition d{\'e}velopp{\'e}e {\`a} CCR. Le travail a port{\'e} sur le d{\'e}veloppement des modules de vuln{\'e}rabilit{\'e} et de dommages sp{\'e}cifiques {\`a} l'agriculture. Le mod{\`e}le de vuln{\'e}rabilit{\'e} a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e} {\`a} partir du registre parcellaire graphique et le module de dommages a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e} {\`a} partir des courbes de dommages {\`a} l'agriculture d{\'e}velopp{\'e}es par le groupe de travail national Analyse Multi-Crit{\`e}res inondation {\`a} travers les travaux de l'IRSTEA. Le mod{\`e}le d'al{\'e}a utilis{\'e} est le mod{\`e}le d{\'e}velopp{\'e} par CCR depuis 2003. Le dernier chapitre est pens{\'e} comme une base technique pour CCR afin de pouvoir continuer les travaux d'{\'e}largissement du p{\'e}rim{\`e}tre des impacts mod{\'e}lis{\'e}s. Tout d'abord, un {\'e}tat des lieux des travaux r{\'e}alis{\'e}s (risques automobile et agricole) et en cours (pertes d'exploitations cons{\'e}cutives {\`a} un dommage direct) est r{\'e}alis{\'e} et replac{\'e} dans le contexte de la mod{\'e}lisation globale des impacts propos{\'e}e {\`a} CCR. Pour les impacts non trait{\'e}s, nous pr{\'e}senterons les probl{\'e}matiques de mod{\'e}lisation, un court {\'e}tat de l'art et les conclusions que nous en avons tir{\'e}es en terme de mod{\'e}},

This SAM is a comprehensive and economy-wide data framework representing the regional economy, including an input-output table for five sectors, a balance of payments between Corsica, other French continental regions and the rest of the world. The SAM provides the first coherent macroeconomic representation of the Corsican economy and allows for a consistent analysis of the relationships between key macroeconomic variables. It shows that the trade deficit of Corsica is 20\% of GDP despite the significant contribution of tourism. This deficit is financed by net public transfers from the rest of France. A second contribution of the SAM is to open a new research agenda on the Corsican regional economy. In particular it will make a calibration of a regional Computable General Equilibrium Model possible.},

  Title= {Simultaneous Supply and Demand Constraints in Input-Output
Networks: the Case of Covid-19 in Germany, Italy, and
Spain},
  Abstract= {Natural and anthropogenic disasters frequently affect both
the supply and demand side of an economy. A striking recent
example is the Covid-19 pandemic which has created severe
disruptions to economic output in most countries. These
direct shocks to supply and demand will propagate
downstream and upstream through production networks. Given
the exogenous shocks, we derive a lower bound on total
shock propagation. We find that even in this best case
scenario network effects substantially amplify the initial
shocks. To obtain more realistic model predictions, we
study the propagation of shocks bottom-up by imposing
different rationing rules on industries if they are not
able to satisfy incoming demand. Our results show that
economic impacts depend strongly on the emergence of input
bottlenecks, making the rationing assumption a key variable
in predicting adverse economic impacts. We further
establish that the magnitude of initial shocks and network
density heavily influence model predictions.},

	abstract     = {Accurate flood forecasts are critical to an efficient flood event management strategy. Until now, hydro-meteorological forecasts have mainly been used to establish early-warnings in France (meteorological and flood vigilance maps) or over the world (flash-flood guidances). These forecasts are typically limited either to the main streams covered by the flood forecasting services or to watersheds with specific assets like check dams, which in most cases are well gauged river sections, thus leaving aside large parts of the territory. This paper presents a distributed hydro-meteorological forecasting approach, which makes use of the high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall estimates that are now available, to provide information at ungauged sites. The proposed system intended to detect road inundation risks had initially been developed and tested in areas of limited size. This paper presents the extension of such a system to an entire region (i.e. the Gard region in Southern France), including over 2000 crossing points between rivers and roads and its validation with respect to a large data set of actual reported road inundations observed during recent flash flood events. These initial validation results appear to be most promising. The eventual proposed tool would provide the necessary information for flood event management services to identify the areas at risk and adopt appropriate safety and rescue measures: i.e. pre-positioning of rescue equipment, interruption of the traffic on the exposed roads and determination of safe access or evacuation routes. Moreover, beyond the specific application to the supervision of a road network, the research undertaken herein also provides results for the performance of hydro-meteorological forecasts on ungauged headwaters.},

Droughts can affect a wide range of socio-economic sectors while the related direct and indirect impacts are often difficult to quantify. In this context, drought damage refers to the total or partial destruction of physical assets in the affected area. The main constraint in constructing a robust relationship between the severity of drought events and related damages is the lack of sufficient quantitative impact data. In this paper we propose the use of power-law damage functions to assess the relationship between drought severity and related damages in two economic sectors, namely cereal crop production and hydropower generation, across 21 European countries. The different shapes of the resulting damage functions can be explained by the specific drought vulnerability or adaptive capacity of each sector and country. Due to the scarcity of impact data linked to extreme climate events a bootstrap resampling was performed to assess the potential uncertainties associated with the sample size. This approach helps communicating potential drought impacts and related uncertainties to end users and policy makers in support to the development of drought management plans and long-term adaptation measures.},

We point out the possible utilization of the datasets, applying GIS techniques, for highlighting road sections that, due to adjacency of high forest stands, are sensitive to closure by storm-felled trees. Indicators reflecting the reduced access to different areas or to the population in need of emergency aid can be derived based on the parameter tree height along roads and road network analysis. As a case in this study, the methodology is applied to elderly people (+80~years) with possible need of daily care at home following a severe storm. A comparison to the extreme 2005 storm felling in southern Sweden reveals that only limited estimates of road network disruption due to storm-felled trees are possible using the indicators, as other factors, for example, wind direction, which determine the exact impact of a particular storm are not taken into account. However, the indicators and network analysis also provide a possibility to draw attention to locations where disruptions of the road network would have significant effects on the accessibility to large surrounding areas. Potential critical road closures can be identified and preventive measures considered locally at these points.},

  Title= {Regional Economic Impacts of a Verdugo Scenario Earthquake
Disruption of Los Angeles Water Supplies: a Computable
General Equilibrium Analysis},
  Abstract= { This paper advances the state of the art in the
development and application of a computable general
equilibrium model to estimate the business interruption
impacts of a Verdugo scenario earthquake on the water
system serving Los Angeles. The model has been especially
designed to incorporate engineering and spatial aspects of
this system in the context of the regional economy to
include resilience responses at various water outage
levels. The Verdugo earthquake scenario and Monte Carlo
simulations show that water outages in LA County could
result in business interruption losses of several billion
dollars without any resilience adjustment. However, a
reduction of these losses by more than 90\% is possible
through the application of several types of resilience on
the customer side, most prominently rescheduling
production, in addition to conservation, input
substitution, and storage of water. Allowing the price of
water to rise to reflect its scarcity would reduce the
losses even further. },

To study the upstream and downstream propagation of these industry-specific demand and supply shocks, we build a dynamic input-output model inspired by previous work on the economic response to natural disasters. We argue that standard production functions, at least in their most parsimonious parametrizations, are not adequate to model input substitutability in the context of Covid-19 shocks. We use a survey of industry analysts to evaluate, for each industry, which inputs were absolutely necessary for production over a short time period. We calibrate our model on the UK economy and study the economic effects of the lockdown that was imposed at the end of March and gradually released in May. Looking back at predictions that we released in May, we show that the model predicted aggregate dynamics very well, and sectoral dynamics to a large extent. We discuss the relative extent to which the model's dynamics and performance was due to the choice of the production function or the choice of an exogenous shock scenario. To further explore the behavior of the model, we use simpler scenarios with only demand or supply shocks, and find that popular metrics used to predict a priori the impact of shocks, such as output multipliers, are only mildly useful.},

A striking recent example is the Covid-19 pandemic which has created severe disruptions to economic output in most countries. These direct shocks to supply and demand will propagate downstream and upstream through production networks. Given the exogenous shocks, we derive a lower bound on total shock propagation. We find that even in this best case scenario network effects substantially amplify the initial shocks. To obtain more realistic model predictions, we study the propagation of shocks bottom-up by imposing different rationing rules on industries if they are not able to satisfy incoming demand. Our results show that economic impacts depend strongly on the emergence of input bottlenecks, making the rationing assumption a key variable in predicting adverse economic impacts. We further establish that the magnitude of initial shocks and network density heavily influence model predictions.},

	abstract     = {Disruptions to transportation networks by natural hazard events cause direct losses (e.g. by physical damage) and indirect socio-economic losses via travel delays and decreased transportation efficiency. The severity and spatial distribution of these losses varies according to user travel demands and which links, nodes or infrastructure assets are physically disrupted. Increasing transport network resilience, for example by targeted mitigation strategies, requires the identification of the critical network segments which if disrupted would incur undesirable or unacceptable socio-economic impacts. Here, these impacts are assessed on a national road transportation network by coupling hazard data with a transport network model. This process is illustrated using a case study of landslide hazards on the road network of Scotland. A set of possible landslide-prone road segments is generated using landslide susceptibility data. The results indicate that at least 152 road segments are susceptible to landslides, which could cause indirect economic losses exceeding \textsterling{}35 k for each day of closure. In addition, previous estimates for historic landslide events might be significant underestimates. For example, the estimated losses for the 2007 A83 'Rest and Be Thankful' landslide are \textsterling{}80 k day-1, totalling \textsterling{}1.2 million over a 15 day closure, and are \textasciitilde{}60\% greater than previous estimates. The spatial distribution of impact to road users is communicated in terms of 'extended hazard impact footprints'. These footprints reveal previously unknown exposed communities and unanticipated spatial patterns of severe disruption. Beyond cost-benefit analyses for landslide mitigation efforts, the approach implemented is applicable to other natural hazards (e.g. flooding), combinations of hazards, or even other network disruption events.},

	abstract     = {Most climate change impacts manifest in the form of natural hazards. Damage assessment typically relies on damage functions that translate the magnitude of extreme events to a quantifiable damage. In practice, the availability of damage functions is limited due to a lack of data sources and a lack of understanding of damage processes. The study of the characteristics of damage functions for different hazards could strengthen the theoretical foundation of damage functions and support their development and validation. Accordingly, we investigate analogies of damage functions for coastal flooding and for wind storms and identify a unified approach. This approach has general applicability for granular portfolios and may also be applied, for example, to heatrelated mortality. Moreover, the unification enables the transfer of methodology between hazards and a consistent treatment of uncertainty. This is demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis on the basis of two simple case studies (for coastal flood and storm damage). The analysis reveals the relevance of the various uncertainty sources at varying hazard magnitude and on both the microscale and the macroscale level. Main findings are the dominance of uncertainty from the hazard magnitude and the persistent behaviour of intrinsic uncertainties on both scale levels. Our results shed light on the general role of uncertainties and provide useful insight for the application of the unified approach.},

The potential to reduce these losses brings many benefits, but every mitigation activity has a cost that must be considered in our world of limited resources. In principle benefit-cost analysis (BCA) can be used to assess a mitigation activity's expected net benefits (discounted future benefits less discounted costs), but in practice this often proves difficult. This paper reports on a study that refined BCA methodologies and applied them to a national statistical sample of FEMA mitigation activities over a ten-year period for earthquake, flood, and wind hazards. The results indicate that the overall benefit-cost ratio for FEMA mitigation grants is about 4 to 1, though the ratio varies according to hazard and mitigation type.},

  Abstract= { This paper investigates the construction of
multisector-multiregion input-output tables by using
spatial econometric methods. I demonstrate that, under
reasonable assumptions, the problem of finding Leontief's
technical coeffecients can be formulated as a modified
multi-equation spatial Durbin model and the missing
parameters can be estimated via maximum likelihood. The
resulting coefficients are computed as a function of
country-wide coeffiecients, as well as distance and
regional-sectorial data on value added. The statistical
performance of the model is scrutinized and the method is
illustrated with simulations of regional (NUTS-3 level)
economic impact assessment - for generic companies located
in Southern France, Germany and Poland. },

The model has been especially designed to incorporate engineering and spatial aspects of this system in the context of the regional economy to include resilience responses at various water outage levels. The Verdugo earthquake scenario and Monte Carlo simulations show that water outages in LA County could result in business interruption losses of several billion dollars without any resilience adjustment. However, a reduction of these losses by more than 90\% is possible through the application of several types of resilience on the customer side, most prominently rescheduling production, in addition to conservation, input substitution, and storage of water. Allowing the price of water to rise to reflect its scarcity would reduce the losses even further.},

Moreover, we have designed the methodology in a manner that overcomes the major shortcomings of the supply-driven approach. We apply the methodology to a 90-day disruption at the twin seaports of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, which is a major port area that includes a petrochemical manufacturing complex.

For California, total economic impacts represent the general equilibrium (essentially quantity and price multiplier) effects of lost production in industries upstream and downstream in the supply-chain of sectors that are directly impacted by port cargo disruptions at Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach (POLA/POLB), property damage along the coast, and evacuation of potentially inundated areas.

Secondly, the role of the use of measurable flow data on the fundamental structure of the models is explored. The opening section uncovers an anomaly in the classical approach when flows between regions of final demand products, external exports and imports are neglected in comparison to the flows of internal intermediate inputs. Next, we introduce uncertainty into the analysis by extending an entropy formulation developed by Wilson, which itself evolved from the formalism established by Leontief-Strout (L-S). The main enhancements include (i) the introduction of regional output capacities to capture spillovers from regions operating close to capacity, (ii) the inclusion of flows of external imports and exports and (iii) the use of total measurable flows as input which are readily available from surveys, yielding as output not only the total flows of each sector between each pair of regions, but (optionally) the further disaggregation of these flows to include their final destination sector or their use as final demand. In fact, a key objective is to structurally account for the joint influence of technology, output capacities and transportation costs on the pattern of intermediate and final demand flows between regions. Further extensions of the approach lead to the generation of probabilistic supply functions as tools within a potential CGE analysis. This option requires the introduction of prices, permitting a profit constraint to replace the simple transport cost constraint of the earlier models.},

	abstract     = {Several European policies have been designed over the last decades to address the challenge of climate change and several measures have been put in place to accelerate the development and deployment of cost-effective low carbon technologies. The domestic nature of the resource and its great potential availability in Europe make biomass conversion technologies relevant mitigation options to be considered. In this context, the project "Logistics for Energy Crops Biomass (LogistEC)" aims to develop new or improve technologies of biomass logistics chain. In this project, the sustainability of different types of biomass is analysed in terms of environmental, economic and social impacts, based on the supply chain of two existing plants. The objective of this paper is to present the main results obtained in the socio-economic analysis of the French case and its climate change consequences. The Input-Output Analysis (IOA) has been seen as the most appropriate method to estimate these impacts using a Multiregional Input-Output Table~from the World Input-Output Database project. Socio-economic effects have been estimated in terms of additional economic activity, added value and job creation. By extending the IOA with environmental accounts, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have also been estimated. Additionally, the most stimulated sectors have been identified. Results highlight the importance of biomass at a national level.},

Most macro-economic models start from a neoclassical economic perspective and focus on equilibrium outcomes, either in a static or dynamic way, and describe economic processes at a high level of aggregation. As a consequence, they typically fail to account for the complexity of social interactions and other behavioural responses of consumers and producers to disasters, which may affect the macroeconomic impacts of floods. Employing evolutionary principles and methods, such as agent-based modelling, may help to address some of the shortcomings of current macro-economic models. We explore and discuss the implications of applying consumer and producer heterogeneity, bounded rationality, network effects, social and technological learning, co-evolution and adaptive policy-making concepts into existing economic frameworks for the assessment of macro-economic impacts of floods.},

Invoking the principles of input-output (I-O) and decomposition analysis, the article offers a framework for describing how terrorism-induced perturbations can propagate due to interconnectedness. Data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce is utilized to present applications to serve as test beds for the proposed framework. Specifically, a case study estimating the economic impact of airline demand perturbations to national-level U.S. sectors is made possible using I-O matrices. A ranking of the affected sectors according to their vulnerability to perturbations originating from a primary sector (e.g., air transportation) can serve as important input to risk management. For example, limited resources can be prioritized for the "top-n" sectors that are perceived to suffer the greatest economic losses due to terrorism. In addition, regional decomposition via location quotients enables the analysis of local-level terrorism events. The Regional I-O Multiplier System II (RIMS II) Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency responsible for releasing the regional multipliers for various geographical resolutions (economic areas, states, and counties). A regional-level case study demonstrates a process of estimating the economic impact of transportation-related scenarios on industry sectors within Economic Area 010 (the New York metropolitan region and vicinities).},

An extensive knowledge about flood conditioning factors and a diverse set of methodologies for flood susceptibility evaluations are available, although there is still field for improvement regarding methodologies for small-scale flood susceptibility assessment, particularly relevant in data-scarce contexts. This research applied to mainland Portugal, introduces a multicriteria methodology to assess flood susceptibility at national scale considering three flood-conditioning factors: flow accumulation, average slope angle and average relative permeability. These three factors resume other factors usually considered in literature, related to morphology and potential runoff. This work includes data from the flood conditioning factors considering the cumulative role of the entire contributive area and not only the on-site characteristics. The weight of each factor was assigned based on expert opinion and validated using available flood damages databases with {$>$}150 years of records. From the several tested flood susceptibility models, the one that best fits the historical records was chosen, which corresponds also to a more valued role of flow accumulation factor. Results provide an accurate differentiation of transboundary, regional and local rivers. The scores of stream flood susceptibility were later transformed to a single value per each of the 278 municipalities of mainland Portugal. Representing the natural susceptibility to river flooding, these results can be cross-analyzed with structural mitigation measures, spatial planning instruments, exposure and vulnerability data along the respective floodplains, in order to identify water streams that require a more detailed and concerned future intervention and an exhaustive susceptibility study at the local scale.},

	abstract     = {Recent flash flood impact studies highlight that road networks are often disrupted due to adverse weather and flash flood events. Road users are thus particularly exposed to road flooding during their daily mobility. Previous exposure studies, however, do not take into consideration population mobility. Recent advances in transportation research provide an appropriate framework for simulating individual travelactivity patterns using an activity-based approach. These activity-based mobility models enable the prediction of the sequence of activities performed by individuals and locating them with a high spatial-temporal resolution. This paper describes the development of the MobRISK microsimulation system: a model for assessing the exposure of road users to extreme hydrometeorological events. MobRISK aims at providing an accurate spatiotemporal exposure assessment by integrating travel-activity behaviors and mobility adaptation with respect to weather disruptions. The model is applied in a flash-flood-prone area in southern France to assess motorists' exposure to the September 2002 flash flood event. The results show that risk of flooding mainly occurs in principal road links with considerable traffic load. However, a lag time between the timing of the road submersion and persons crossing these roads contributes to reducing the potential vehicle-related fatal accidents. It is also found that sociodemographic variables have a significant effect on individual exposure. Thus, the proposed model demonstrates the benefits of considering spatiotemporal dynamics of population exposure to flash floods and presents an important improvement in exposure assessment methods. Such improved characterization of road user exposures can present valuable information for flood risk management services.},

We argue that under these circumstances existing economic evaluation toolkits do not adequately support decision-making. Our paper outlines the key economic evaluation tools used in decision-making and, in turn, advances a research agenda for future development and application of these approaches. Priority challenges to be addressed include resilience thinking, multi-capital assessment, valuing the future, accounting for distributional equity, social appetite for risk, and deep uncertainty. We also recommend a strong focus on capacity and capability building to improve the risk literacy of decision-makers.},

	abstract     = {Natural hazards pose significant risks to people and assets in many regions of the world. Quantifying associated risks is crucial for many applications such as adaptation option appraisal and insurance pricing. However, traditional risk assessment approaches have focused on the impacts of single hazards, ignoring the effects of multi-hazard risks and potentially leading to underestimations or overestimations of risks. In this work, we present a framework for modelling multi-hazard risks globally in a consistent way, considering hazards, exposures, vulnerabilities, and assumptions on recovery. We illustrate the approach using river floods and tropical cyclones impacting people and physical assets on a global scale in a changing climate. To ensure physical consistency, we combine single hazard models that were driven by the same climate model realizations. Our results show that incorporating common physical drivers and recovery considerably alters the multi-hazard risk. This framework is implemented in the open-source climate risk assessment platform CLIMADA and can be applied to various hazards and exposures, providing a more comprehensive approach to risk management than conventional methods.},

In the aftermath of the catastrophe, authorities have to address a great number of issues. We show, using basic principles, that input-output methodology offers a flexible set of tools to address three fundamental issues: (1) obtaining a systematic insight in the imbalances that exist in the non-affected area after the catastrophe, (2) determining the nature of these imbalances and the way they affect options in the recovery process, and (3) introducing the elements of a cost-benefit analysis in the context of prevention and precautionary policies. Our approach strongly supports the need for extensive contingency planning in the presence of major natural hazards. A numerical example accompanies the various steps of the exercise.},

	abstract     = {Losses due to floods have dramatically increased over the past decades, and losses of companies, comprising direct and indirect losses, have a large share of the total economic losses. Thus, there is an urgent need to gain more quantitative knowledge about flood losses, particularly losses caused by business interruption, in order to mitigate the economic loss of companies. However, business interruption caused by floods is rarely assessed because of a lack of sufficiently detailed data. A survey was undertaken to explore processes influencing business interruption, which collected information on 557 companies affected by the severe flood in June 2013 in Germany. Based on this data set, the study aims to assess the business interruption of directly affected companies by means of a Random Forests model. Variables that influence the duration and costs of business interruption were identified by the variable importance measures of Random Forests. Additionally, Random Forest-based models were developed and tested for their capacity to estimate business interruption duration and associated costs. The water level was found to be the most important variable influencing the duration of business interruption. Other important variables, relating to the estimation of business interruption duration, are the warning time, perceived danger of flood recurrence and inundation duration. In contrast, the amount of business interruption costs is strongly influenced by the size of the company, as assessed by the number of employees, emergency measures undertaken by the company and the fraction of customers within a 50 km radius. These results provide useful information and methods for companies to mitigate their losses from business interruption. However, the heterogeneity of companies is relatively high, and sector-specific analyses were not possible due to the small sample size. Therefore, further sector-specific analyses on the basis of more flood loss data of companies are recommended.},

	abstract     = {This research aims at designing and testing a methodology to improve urban resilience which includes both technical and organizational aspects. Ensuring the resilience of their territory is a major issue for local authorities, but the complexity of the stakes makes implementing this promising concept difficult. This research focuses on urban services, assuming that they are a necessary, but although insufficient, prerequisite to city resilience. Indeed, urban services are the backbone of urban functions and they are levers for action by authorities. Furthermore their technical and organizational specificities embody the urban system's complexity. Urban service manager collaboration is then relevant insofar that their interdependency is a critical resilience issue. The methodology to identify and asses urban service interdependencies is tested on the Parisian region. The future 100-year flood of the river Seine is a major concern for Parisian authorities, however planned responses are still disconnected. The collaborative approach constructed with Parisian managers highlights the importance of interdependency management. It also identifies margins for improvement in urban service resilience. Larger territorial scales must also be taken into account, including through urban planning and long term strategies. Hence, all stakeholders can be involved in order to feed and implement this continuous resilience improvement.},

	abstract     = {Countries' economic activity as well as their fiscal position are vulnerable to climate- and weather related extreme events. Existing research shows that effects on GDP may be either positive or negative, while fiscal implications are clearly negative. Current literature focuses on fiscal implications at the national level. Predicted increases in climate- and weather related extreme events, though, are regionally highly variable. Hence, information concerning the regional vulnerability to specific extreme events is a vital input for adaptation policies. To answer this information demand, this article looks at how flood damages to public infrastructure affect four budget figures (current income balance, asset management balance, financial transaction balance, and the annual result), exploring the case of Upper Austrian municipalities. Based on a dynamic model and a sample of 442 municipalities from 2009 to 2014 it is found that damages to public infrastructure have a negative impact on municipalities' current income balance and their annual result. This indicates a weakening of municipalities' financial situation. To increase municipalities' budgetary resilience with regards to public flood damages, municipalities can revert to stricter land use regulation and precautionary measures such as wet- or dry-flood proofing, or to flood insurance.},

	abstract     = {Flash-floods are among the most devastating hazards in the Mediterranean. A major subset of damage and casualties caused by flooding is related to road submersion. Distributed hydrological nowcasting can be used for road flooding monitoring. This requires rainfall-runoff simulations at a high space and time resolution. Distributed hydrological models, such as the ISBA-TOP coupled system used in this study, are designed to simulate discharges for any cross-section of a river but they are generally calibrated for certain outlets and give deteriorated results for the sub-catchment outlets. The paper first analyses ISBA-TOP discharge simulations in the French Mediterranean region for target points different from the outlets used for calibration. The sensitivity of the model to its governing factors is examined to highlight the validity of results obtained for ungauged river sections compared with those obtained for the main gauged outlets. The use of improved model inputs is found beneficial for sub-catchments simulation. The calibration procedure however provides the parameters' values for the main outlets only and these choices influence the simulations for ungauged catchments or sub-catchments. As a result, a new version of ISBA-TOP system without any parameter to calibrate is used to produce diagnostics relevant for quantifying the risk of road submersion. A first diagnostic is the simulated runoff spatial distribution, it provides a useful information about areas with a high risk of submersion. Then an indicator of the flood severity is given by simulated discharges presented with respect to return periods. The latter has to be used together with information about the vulnerability of road-river cross-sections.},

	abstract     = {Traditional risk assessments use asset losses as the main metric to measure the severity of a disaster. Here, an expanded risk assessment is proposed based on a framework that adds "socioeconomic resilience" - that is, the ability of affected households to cope with and recover from disaster asset losses - and uses "wellbeing losses" as its main measure of disaster severity. Using a new agent-based model that represents explicitly the recovery and reconstruction process at the household level, this risk assessment provides new insights into disaster risks in the Philippines. Its first conclusion is the close link between natural disasters and poverty. On average, estimates suggest that almost half a million Filipinos per year face transient consumption poverty due to natural disasters. Nationally, the bottom income quintile suffers only 9\% of the total asset losses, but 31\% of the total wellbeing losses. As a result of the disproportionate impact on poor people, the average annual wellbeing losses due to disasters in the Philippines is estimated at US\.4 billion. The second conclusion is the fact that the regions identified as priorities for risk-management interventions differ depending on which risk metric is used. While cost-benefit analyses based on asset losses direct risk reduction investments toward the richest regions and areas, a focus on poverty or wellbeing rebalances the analysis and generates a different set of regional priorities. Finally, measuring disaster impacts through poverty and wellbeing impacts allows the quantification of the benefits from interventions like rapid post-disaster support and adaptive social protection. While these measures do not reduce asset losses, they efficiently reduce their wellbeing consequences by making the population more resilient.},

The spatial mismatch between water resource and electricity generation is highlighted and analyzed. It is estimated that the water use will be a vital constraint for future electricity generation in some regions. The technological water saving potential is evaluated to address this issue. In terms of consumption, space cooling/heating and water heating are identified as the most significant nexus-related coupled nodes at the household end-use level. Gaps in the theoretical nexus concept and practical policymaking are summarized herein. Existing policies in the {US} and Europe related to the water-electricity nexus are also reviewed. This study highlights that the generation and cooling technologies greatly influence the water consumption and withdrawal for electricity generation; tremendous spatial disparities of local water resources and electricity generation exist; residential behavior and household appliances have an impact on the household water-electricity nexus; and comprehensive management of the couplings between water and energy is lacking and urgently required.},

	abstract     = {When considering the disruption to traffic on roads, the flood immunity is usually considered as the design criterion. However in addition to the flood immunity, the time of closure is at least equally important. In fact a road with a low level of flood immunity may result in less disruption than another with higher flood immunity if the times of closure are shorter. Times of closure on roads can be expressed as the time of closure for a defined large design flood, such as the 2\% AEP flood or the duration for a major historical flood. The times can also be expressed as an average annual time of closure (AATOC), which depends on the frequency of closure and the duration of closure on each event. These two parameters along with the flood immunity can give a better indication of disruption to transport than flood immunity alone. AATOC can be considered similarly to the average annual time of submergence (AATOS), defined as the times when there is any water on the road, no matter how shallow. Calculation of the AATOC has typically been calculated using a procedure described in the Austroads Waterway Guide, which relies on calculations using design flood hydrographs. Experience with this procedure has shown that it typically underestimates the AATOC, especially where the flood immunity is low, because observed floods will often have a longer duration than design floods and also because there may be more than one flood in any year that closes the road. This paper outlines investigations into the calculation of AATOC and provides guidance on a more reliable method for calculating AATOC for application in studies into the flood immunity of roads. 2012 Engineers Australia.},

Comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of multiple disasters on the industrial and economic system has become an urgent and essential part of urban recovery and sustainable development. However, there is a lack of studies that focus on assessing the indirect economic impacts resulting from such multiple events, and thereafter providing a common quantitative approach within their assessment. With the concept of flood footprint and input-output theory, this study proposes a more externally oriented methodology (flood footprint model) for indirect flood footprint (IFF) accounting and offers various extensive sensitivity analyses based on a hypothetical two-flood event. Based on the two-flood case, we conclude that the total flood footprint of a multi-flood within a given region is larger than the sum of individual flood footprints and this is the same for the IFF due to the combination effect, while the flood footprint is highly constrained by factors such as occurrence time and physical damage caused by the ensuing disaster. This article is part of the theme issue 'Urban flood resilience'.},

	abstract     = {Multiregion input-output (MRIO) models have become increasingly important in economic and environmental analysis. However, the current resolution of most MRIO models fails to capture the heterogeneity between subregions, especially in cities. The lack of city-level MRIO tables has impeded the accomplishment of city-level studies and hampered the understanding of the relationship between urban growth and consumption, and teleconnections to other regions. In this paper, we propose a partial survey-based multiple-layer framework for MRIO table compilation of a Chinese province that distinguishes city-based regions. This framework can effectively address a large number of data processes and retain consistency between layers. Using the framework, we first compile a nested Hebei-China city-level MRIO table and then apply city-level energy footprint accounting of the North China urban agglomeration. Our results present the critical role of Hebei cities in energy supply in 2012 and quantify energy use embodied in goods for the domestic trade. Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Handan are distinctive cities in the energy supply chain of other regions, for both less developed and developed regions. This multiple-layer framework represents a feasible approach for developing subregional-level MRIO models and offers the possibility to analyze global trade at the subregional level with limited data. The data and results from the analysis in this article are available for download from China Emission Accounts and Datasets.},
