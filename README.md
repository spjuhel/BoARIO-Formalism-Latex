The ARIO model Formal documentation
===================================

This repository contains the latex files used to generate the formal documentation of the ARIO model associated 
with the [BoARIO python package](https://spjuhel.github.io/BoARIO/boario-references.html) (or on [Github](https://github.com/spjuhel/BoARIO/))

Currently two documents are released from this project:

- `book.pdf` which contains both an extensive literature review on the ARIO model and the formal documentation.
- `model.pdf` which contains only the formal documentation.

You can download either of those files from the latest release [here](https://github.com/spjuhel/BoARIO-Formalism-Latex/releases/latest).
